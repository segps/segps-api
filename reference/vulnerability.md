### Making API Calls
These URLs allow you to access the search functionality of SE-GPS from any non-browser user agent. Note that the "wt" parameter present in every URL determines the format of the results. 
Setting "wt" equal to "json" will provide a JSON response, while setting "wt" equal to "xml" will provide the same response formatted as an XML document. 
Another common parameter is "rows," which limits the number of results returned by the server. 

NOTE: Most of the URLs in this document have been URL-decoded for the sake of readability. They should work when pasted into a web browser, but you may have to URL-encode them to function when called programmatically
